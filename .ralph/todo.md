### To do

- [ ] use the Vercel AI SDK

API key dialog

- [ ] trigger "save api key" on paste if the text is valid
- [ ] don't treat the api key as a password - it's ok to show it on screen
- [ ] add some padding around the "Get your api key..." label
- [ ] The "API key" label before the input is redundant

### Done

- [x] The results display and the skeleton view should use the same component for the language cards (currently the language names are displayed differently)
- [x] Let me drag and drop languages to reorder
- [x] In the results, put the language name in a little badge on the border
- [x] Change the language interface to autocomplete. I shouldn't have to know the two-letter code for a language.
- [x] Make the results more compact: less padding, smaller text
- [x] Make the default languages Catalan, Spanish, French, and Portuguese
- [x] Make the submit button blue
