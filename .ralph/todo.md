### To do

- [ ] the input should select all on focus

### Done

- [x] add more lines to the loading skeleton
- [x] When I refresh results, the new results should replace the old ones. So there should only ever be one set of results for any one string.
- [x] Make the heading "Translate" smaller and change it to "Universal Translator"
