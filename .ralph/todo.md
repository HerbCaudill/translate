### To do

- [ ] English should be one of the default languages and if what I type isn't in English then it should translate it to Engish and not into the language it's already in. so there needs to be a separate step of identifying the language
- [ ] use the Vercel AI SDK

API key dialog

- [ ] trigger "save api key" on paste if the text is valid

### Done

- [x] Remove redundant "API key" label and add padding around "Get your api key..." text

- [x] don't treat the api key as a password - it's ok to show it on screen

- [x] The results display and the skeleton view should use the same component for the language cards (currently the language names are displayed differently)
- [x] Let me drag and drop languages to reorder
- [x] In the results, put the language name in a little badge on the border
- [x] Change the language interface to autocomplete. I shouldn't have to know the two-letter code for a language.
- [x] Make the results more compact: less padding, smaller text
- [x] Make the default languages Catalan, Spanish, French, and Portuguese
- [x] Make the submit button blue
