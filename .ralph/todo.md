### To do

- [ ] Let me drag and drop languages to reorder

### Done

- [x] In the results, put the language name in a little badge on the border
- [x] Change the language interface to autocomplete. I shouldn't have to know the two-letter code for a language.
- [x] Make the results more compact: less padding, smaller text
- [x] Make the default languages Catalan, Spanish, French, and Portuguese
- [x] Make the submit button blue
