### To do

- [ ] The results container should occupy the remaining vertical space on the page, so that the white space below it is still part of the swipe left/right target

### Done

- [x] The check button on the ios floating toolbar should submit

- [x] the input should select all on focus
- [x] add more lines to the loading skeleton
- [x] When I refresh results, the new results should replace the old ones. So there should only ever be one set of results for any one string.
- [x] Make the heading "Translate" smaller and change it to "Universal Translator"
- [x] On mobile, don't zoom when focusing the input
- [x] On mobile, the results should be in their own scroll container. Otherwise it should not be possible to scroll or zoom the page.
